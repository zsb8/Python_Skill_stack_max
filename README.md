# Python_stack_max

# The task:    
give an implementation of a stack with an additional function max()    
stack contains integers only     
max() should return in constant time complexity O(1)      

This is a simply question, don't scared by these word. The object can be explained as below:    
(1) You have a list, input and output data, such as a stack.      
(2) If you input 1 and 2, you need to find a way to calculate the max value is 2.  [1,2] you need to get the result is 2.     
(3) If you input some data  and the list will be [4, 6, 1, 2, 4, -1, 10],  so you need to know the result is 10.      
(4) There are some ways to get the max() value, but find the best way. The best way is use lest computer resources (include space and time).     
(5) Don't use max(), because it is simple and easy but the time is not good. constant time complexity is O(n).
